# High Issues

## H-1: Functions send eth away from contract but performs no checks on any address.

Consider introducing checks for `msg.sender` to ensure the recipient of the money is as intended.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Token.sol [Line: 43](src/Token.sol#L43)

	```solidity
	    function attack(uint256 amount) public {
	```

</details>



## H-2: Return value of the function call is not checked.

Function returns a value but it is ignored.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Token.sol [Line: 50](src/Token.sol#L50)

	```solidity
	            token.transfer(address(this), 20);
	```

- Found in src/Token.sol [Line: 57](src/Token.sol#L57)

	```solidity
	            token.transfer(receiver, 20);
	```

</details>



## H-3: Tautology or Contradiction in comparison.

The condition has been determined to be either always true or always false due to the integer range in which we're operating.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Token.sol [Line: 22](src/Token.sol#L22)

	```solidity
	        require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0);
	```

- Found in src/Token.sol [Line: 56](src/Token.sol#L56)

	```solidity
	        if (token.balanceOf(address(this)) >= 0) {
	```

</details>



## H-4: Unchecked Low level calls

The return value of the low-level call is not checked, so if the call fails, the Ether will be locked in the contract. If the low level is used to prevent blocking operations, consider logging failed calls. Ensure that the return value of a low-level call is checked or logged.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Token.sol [Line: 44](src/Token.sol#L44)

	```solidity
	        address(this).call{value: 0 ether}("");
	```

</details>



# Low Issues

## L-1: Unsafe ERC20 Operations should not be used

ERC20 functions may not behave as expected. For example: return values are not always meaningful. It is recommended to use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Token.sol [Line: 50](src/Token.sol#L50)

	```solidity
	            token.transfer(address(this), 20);
	```

- Found in src/Token.sol [Line: 57](src/Token.sol#L57)

	```solidity
	            token.transfer(receiver, 20);
	```

</details>



## L-2: Solidity pragma should be specific, not wide

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Telephone.sol [Line: 4](src/Telephone.sol#L4)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
	```

- Found in src/Token.sol [Line: 6](src/Token.sol#L6)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.6.0;
	```

</details>



## L-3: Missing checks for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables

Check for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Telephone.sol [Line: 15](src/Telephone.sol#L15)

	```solidity
	            owner = _owner;
	```

</details>



## L-4: `public` functions not used internally could be marked `external`

Instead of marking a function as `public`, consider marking it as `external` if it is not used internally.

<details><summary>5 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Telephone.sol [Line: 13](src/Telephone.sol#L13)

	```solidity
	    function changeOwner(address _owner) public {
	```

- Found in src/Token.sol [Line: 20](src/Token.sol#L20)

	```solidity
	    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool) {
	```

- Found in src/Token.sol [Line: 28](src/Token.sol#L28)

	```solidity
	    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance) {
	```

- Found in src/Token.sol [Line: 43](src/Token.sol#L43)

	```solidity
	    function attack(uint256 amount) public {
	```

- Found in src/Token.sol [Line: 61](src/Token.sol#L61)

	```solidity
	    function getBalance() public returns (uint256) {
	```

</details>



## L-5: Define and use `constant` variables instead of using literals

If the same constant literal value is used multiple times, create a constant state variable and reference it throughout the contract.

<details><summary>3 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Token.sol [Line: 39](src/Token.sol#L39)

	```solidity
	        token = new Token(20);
	```

- Found in src/Token.sol [Line: 50](src/Token.sol#L50)

	```solidity
	            token.transfer(address(this), 20);
	```

- Found in src/Token.sol [Line: 57](src/Token.sol#L57)

	```solidity
	            token.transfer(receiver, 20);
	```

</details>



## L-6: Empty `require()` / `revert()` statements

Use descriptive reason strings or custom errors for revert paths.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Token.sol [Line: 22](src/Token.sol#L22)

	```solidity
	        require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0);
	```

</details>



## L-7: PUSH0 is not supported by all chains

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Telephone.sol [Line: 4](src/Telephone.sol#L4)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
	```

</details>



## L-8: State variable could be declared constant

State variables that are not updated following deployment should be declared constant to save gas. Add the `constant` attribute to state variables that never change.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Token.sol [Line: 35](src/Token.sol#L35)

	```solidity
	    address public receiver = 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266;
	```

</details>



## L-9: State variable changes but no event is emitted.

State variable changes in this function but no event is emitted.

	```solidity
	    receive() external payable {
	```

</details>



## L-10: State variable could be declared immutable

State variables that are should be declared immutable to save gas. Add the `immutable` attribute to state variables that are only changed in the constructor
